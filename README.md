# Gold Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze past data and predict future gold prices. 

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can forecast gold prices based on various economic indicators and historical trends.

## Features
* Data Cleaning: Preprocessing historical gold price datasets.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing price trends and correlations.
* Modeling: Using Regression algorithms to train the prediction model.
* Evaluation: Checking model accuracy using standard ML metrics.

## How to Run
1. Open the Project_1.ipynb file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
3. Run the cells sequentially to see the data analysis and prediction results.
